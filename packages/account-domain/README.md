## Overview

`account-domain` models the existence conditions for the SaaS world: accounts, workspaces, memberships, and enabled modules. It is pure TypeScript with **no cross-package dependencies** and must stay free of framework SDKs.

## Folder Structure

```
account-domain/
├── src/
│   ├── aggregates/        # Account / workspace / module registry aggregates
│   ├── value-objects/     # Roles, module types, workspace types
│   ├── events/            # Domain events + metadata helpers
│   ├── policies/          # Cross-aggregate guards
│   ├── repositories/      # Interfaces only
│   ├── entities/          # Base entity helpers
│   ├── domain-services/   # Stateless domain logic
│   └── types/             # Shared identifiers
└── __tests__/             # Domain tests
```

All domain code lives under `src/` to keep a single, predictable entrypoint—no parallel `account/`, `workspace/`, or `module-registry/` folders.

## Domain Responsibilities

- **Account**: Provision and suspend the SaaS account; gates workspace creation.
- **Workspace**: Represents the world where SaaS modules run; ties back to an account.
- **Membership**: Binds a user to a workspace with a role (`Owner | Admin | Member | Viewer`).
- **Module Registry**: Lists capabilities (task/issue/payment, etc.) enabled per workspace.

## Event & Time Conventions

- Aggregates record `createdAt` (string) as their creation time.
- Events use `occurredAt` (string) and may carry `causationId` / `correlationId` for causality tracking.

## Event Flow Alignment

The onboarding flow follows the saga described in `docs/new/✨0 3.md`:
1) `AccountCreated` → 2) `WorkspaceCreated` → 3) `MemberJoinedWorkspace` → 4) `ModuleEnabled` → SaaS modules become usable.
Compensation events (`AccountSuspended`, `WorkspaceArchived`, module disablement) protect against partial onboarding.

## Usage Guidelines

- Exported types live under `@ng-events/account-domain`.
- Consumers (platform adapters, UI) should read projections, not mutate aggregates directly.
- Keep all new code free from Angular/Firebase SDKs; integrate through adapters instead.

## Planned additions

- Membership / Invitation policies aligned with Workspace onboarding (Mermaid 架構層).
- Module enablement dependency rules (task/issue/finance/quality/acceptance) kept in `policies/`.
- Read model / projection contracts stay outside the domain; account-domain 僅定義事件與聚合。
