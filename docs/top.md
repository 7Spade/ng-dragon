1.Translate user requirements into clearly defined, analyzable problems, then systematically use Context7 to retrieve and verify the latest official documentation for each component, ensuring all requirements are fully understood and validated. 
1.Sequential-thinking must be used to analyze the problem step by step, ensuring each sub-task is understood and logically validated before proceeding. 
1.Software-planning-mcp must be used to decompose requirements into atomic, sequential, and actionable tasks ready for implementation.
1.Use Angular 20+ to implement a fully reactive, zone-less architecture, and leverage @angular/fire together with @ngrx/signals to integrate Firebase and manage state seamlessly. 
1.Must strictly follow Single Responsibility Principle and clear separation of concerns.
1.Unless explicitly marked as "Spec" or "Final", .md files are considered supplementary descriptions and should not be used as the basis for determining whether implementation is carried out or whether requirements are omitted; implementation behavior is based solely on code and Issue/instruction definitions.
1.Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.
1.All code suggestions, completions, or analysis in this block should use subagent-level reasoning and code generation to optimize speed and accuracy.
1.Break complex tasks into smaller sub-functions automatically.
1.Return only the most concise and efficient code that fulfills the request.
1.Do not view any files as a source for verification.
